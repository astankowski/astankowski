## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Computer Science student. While I enjoy exploring a wide range of topics in this field, lately, Iâ€™ve been mainly focused on building web applications from start to finish. I want to create complete and useful tools, so I guess becoming a full-stack developer is the path Iâ€™m currently pursuing.
